\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\todo[inline]{Dana, please review conclusion}
With \viss\ we introduced a visualization tool to analyze requirements clarification in online communication over time.
Especially agile and distributed projects demand such analysis: agile projects often only sketch requirements in sufficient detail to plan the next iteration and leave the details to be clarified during the development; distributed projects often depend on online communication and challenge their project managers' ability to assess the shared understanding in the team. 
Our preliminary evaluation has shown that our visualizations allow managers to identify hotspots, e.g. user stories that are not clear to the team. 
Furthermore, \viss\ supports managers in investigating the cause of those hotspots and in identifying suitable actions to disarm problematic or risky situations where the team has insufficient understanding of requirements.
 
In future work, we will evaluate how practitioners use our tool in their daily work. 
This will help us to gain further insight on how managers can use information about requirements clarification over time and to quantify the benefits that tools like the \viss\ can offer.

Such further evaluation should also relate features of online communication (i.e. network centrality, late clarification, no clarification) with typical problems of requirements related discussions, such as feature creep \cite{Jones1996} or symmetry of ignorance \cite{Fischer2000}.
