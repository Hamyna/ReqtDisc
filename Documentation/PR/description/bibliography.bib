  year = {2012},
  pages = {251--260},
  abstract = {In current project environments, requirements often evolve throughout
	the project and are worked on by stakeholders in large and distributed
	teams. Such teams often use online tools such as mailing lists, bug
	tracking systems or online discussion forums to communicate, clarify
	or coordinate work on requirements. In this kind of environment,
	the expected evolution from initial idea, through clarification,
	to a stable requirement, often stagnates. When project managers are
	not aware of underlying problems, development may proceed before
	requirements are fully understood and stabilized, leading to numerous
	implementation issues and often resulting in the need for early redesign
	and modification.
	
	In this paper, we present an approach to analyzing online requirements
	communication and a method for the detection and classification of
	clarification events in requirement discus- sions. We used our approach
	to analyze online requirements communication in the IBM (r) Rational
	Team Concert (r) (RTC) project and identified a set of six clarification
	patterns. Since a predominant amount of clarifications through the
	lifetime of a requirement is often indicative of problematic requirements,
	our approach lends support to project managers to assess, in real-time,
	the state of discussions around a requirement and promptly react
	to requirements problems.},

  month = {January},
  abstract = {Alistair Cockburn's <I>Writing Effective Use Cases</I> is an approachable,
	informative, and very intelligent treatment of an essential topic
	of software design. "Use cases" describe how "actors" interact with
	computer systems and are essential to software-modeling requirements.
	For anyone who designs software, this title offers some real insight
	into writing use cases that are clear and correct and lead to better
	and less costly software.<p> The focus of this text is on use cases
	that are <I>written</I>, as opposed to modeled in UML. This book
	may change your mind about the advantages of writing step-by-step
	descriptions of the way users (or actors) interact with systems.
	Besides being an exceptionally clear writer, the author has plenty
	to say about what works and what doesn't when it comes to creating
	use cases. There are several standout bits of expertise on display
	here, including excellent techniques for finding the right "scope"
	for use cases. (The book uses a color scheme in which blue indicates
	a sea-level use case that's just right, while higher-level use cases
	are white, and overly detailed ones are indigo. Cockburn also provides
	notational symbols to document these levels of detail within a design.)<p>
	This book contains numerous tips on the writing style for use cases
	and plenty of practical advice for managing projects that require
	a large number of use cases. One particular strength lies in the
	numerous actual use cases (many with impressive detail) that are
	borrowed from real-world projects, and demonstrate both good and
	bad practices. Even though the author expresses a preference for
	the format of use cases, he presents a variety of styles, including
	UML graphical versions. The explanation of how use cases fit into
	the rest of the software engineering process is especially good.
	The book concludes with several dozen concrete tips for writing better
	use cases.<p> Software engineering books often get bogged down in
	theory. Not so in <I>Writing Effective Use Cases</I>, a slender volume
	with a practical focus, a concise presentation style, and something
	truly valuable to say. This book will benefit most anyone who designs
	software for a living. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered:</B>

	in one way or the other. Many environments are initially not considered
	security-related and no security experts are assigned. Requirements
	engineers often fail to recognise indicators for security problems.
	Question/problem: Ignoring security issues early in a project is
	a major source of recurring security problems in practice. Identifying
	security-relevant requirements is labour-intensive and error-prone.
	Security may be neglected in order to finish on time and in budget.
	Principal ideas/results: In this paper, we address this problem by
	presenting a tool-supported method that provides assistance for requirements
	engineering, with an emphasis on security requirements. We investigate
	whether security-relevant requirements can be automatically identified
	using a Bayesian classifier. Our results indicate that this is feasible,
	in particular if the classifier is trained with domain specific data
	and documents from previous projects. Contribution: We show how the
	ability to identify security-relevant requirements can be integrated
	in a workflow of requirements analysis and reuse of experience. In
	practice, this can increase security awareness within the software
	development process. We discuss limitations and potential of this
	approach.},

  abstract = {Requirements Engineering ist die Achillesferse des gesamten Prozesses
	der Softwareentwicklung. Es erfordert Interaktion vieler Beteiligten
	und beinhaltet nicht nur technische, sondern auch soziologische und
	psychologische Aktivit√§ten. Auch wenn alle Beteiligte zu einem Konsens
	kommen, ist das resultierende Anforderungsdokument
	
	meist informell. In den fr¬®uhen Projektphasen ist die Funktionalit√§t
	der zu erstellenden Software noch nicht genau genug verstanden. Das
	macht den Prozess der Formalisierung der Anforderungen zu einem Lernprozess.
	
	
	Wie die Studie von Mich et al. [MFN04] zeigt, wird die √ºberwiegende
	Menge der Anforderungen in nat¬®urlicher Sprache geschrieben. In
	der Praxis sind solche Dokumente meistens vage und enthalten viele
	Inkonsistenzen. Missverst√§ndnisse und Fehler aus der Requirements
	Engineering-Phase wirken sich in sp√§teren Projektphasen aus und
	k√∂nnen potentiell zum Misserfolg des gesamten Projekts f√ºhren.
	
	
	Um Missverst√§ndnisse in den Griff zu bekommen und den Schritt von
	informellen Anforderungen zu einem formalen Modell zu unterst√ºtzen,
	wird in dieser Dissertation ein neuer Ansatz zur Extraktion der dom√§nenspezifischen
	Ontologie
	
	aus Anforderungsdokumenten vorgeschlagen. Eine Ontologie besteht aus
	einer Menge von Termen und Relationen zwischen diesen Termen. Sie
	gibt, verglichen mit einem Glossar, pr√§zisere Begriffsdefinitionen
	und l√§sst weniger Interpretationsspielraum. Nach der Extraktion
	muss die Ontologie auch validiert werden. Die validierte Ontologie
	wird zu der gemeinsamen Sprache f√ºr alle Projektbeteiligte. 
	
	
	Diese Dissertation macht zwei wichtige Beitr√§ge zur Extraktion der
	Ontologie aus Anforderungsdokumenten:
	
	‚Ä¢ Sie implementiert eine halbautomatische Methode, die eine Ontologie
	aus einem Anforderungsdokument extrahiert und diese Anschlie√üend
	validiert.
	
	‚Ä¢ Sie zeigt, wie der traditionelle Prozess der Anforderungsanalyse
	modifiziert werden soll, um die Ontologieextraktion in den Prozess
	zu integriereren.
	
	Das vorgeschlagene Verfahren zur Ontologieextraktion wurde an drei
	Fallstudien evaluiert.},

	In general, arguments for choosing a unit were lacking and decisions
	made while developing the content analysis procedures were not made
	explicit. In this article, it will be illustrated that the currently
	accepted practices concerning the ‚Äòunit of meaning‚Äô are not generally
	applicable to quantitative content analysis of electronic communication.
	Such analysis is affected by ‚Äòunit boundary overlap‚Äô and contextual
	constraints having to do with the technology used. The analysis of
	e-mail communication required a different unit of analysis and segmentation
	procedure. This procedure proved to be reliable, and the subsequent
	coding of these units for quantitative analysis yielded satisfactory
	reliabilities. These findings have implications and recommendations
	for current content analysis practice in CSCL research.},
