\viss is an interactive tool that allows users to dynamically explore data from a software development task management system with a focus on communication and clarification of requirements related issues.
The main control element shows a list of tasks (e.g. workitems in jazz, items in jira, issues in other systems).
The power of \viss is to add visualizations to the selected issues that help to assess the communication in comments related to these issues.

\viss currently supports two different visualizations: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Clarification Trajectories} show how the percentage of communication related to clarifying requirements changes over the lifetime of the issue.
\item \textbf{Social Networks} show who is participating in a discussion related to (a set of) issue(s) and how the actors in the discussion are structured. 
\end{itemize}
