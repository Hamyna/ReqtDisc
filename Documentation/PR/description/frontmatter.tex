\begin{abstract}
This demo introduces \viss as a tool for exploring online communication and analyse clarification of requirements over time.
\viss enables managers to identify hotspots in current development activities, to analyze communication problems, and to identify developers that are knowledgeable about domain or project related issues by offering powerful visualizations.
Our preliminary evaluation shows that \viss offers managers valuable information for their decision making.
