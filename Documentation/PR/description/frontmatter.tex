\begin{abstract}
This demo introduces \viss, a tool for exploring online communication and analysing clarification of requirements over time.
\viss\ enables managers to identify hotspots in current development activities, to analyze communication problems, and to identify developers that are knowledgeable about domain or project related issues through visualizations.
Our preliminary evaluation shows that \viss\ offers managers valuable information for their decision making.
