Since \todo{\footnotesize Read this, change text} tasks crosscut both the technical aspects of collaboration an communication, finding the right tasks at the right time is crucial to the success of a project \cite{Kraut1995}.
Treude and Storey identified the lack of visualizations as one of the most important short comings of today's task management systems \cite{Treude2010}. They also found that dashboards that report on the state of a task management system can become pivotal to task prioritization in critical project phases.

Ellis \todo{\footnotesize Read this, change text} et al. \cite{Ellis2007} report results from interviews of how developers use Bugzilla, a popular task management system. 
The motivation for their study was the design of a visualization tool for tasks. 
One of their key findings was that Bugzilla played a key role in managing the project. 
Their visualization reveals social and historical patterns in tasks, but it does not focus on exploration activities.

Many related studies focus on mining and analyzing quantitative data to reveal information about the evolution of the system or to predict future behaviours but only few works are concerned with visualizing and exploring this information space. 
Treude et al. \cite{Treude2012} present the workitemexplorer, a highly related tool that allows to explore the information stored in a task management system.
Compared to this work, \viss allows the analysis of a very specialized aspect, i.e. the analysis of online communication related to clarification of requirements.
